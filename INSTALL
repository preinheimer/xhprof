0. Install the XHProf extension for PHP

  cd ./xhprof/extension/
  phpize
  ./configure --with-php-config=/usr/bin/php-config
  make
  make test
  make install

1. Once you have XHProf installed, you should enable it. Open your php.ini and add

  [xhprof]
  extension=xhprof.so
  xhprof.output_dir="/var/tmp/xhprof"

2. Extract everything into a directory somewhere
3. Create a symlink from xhprof_runs.php to the xprof_runs_<database of your choice>.php directory in xhprof_lib\utils\
4. Create the table required for xhprof_runs.php, there should be sample instructions inside that document alongside
    the constructor.
5. Edit xhprof_lib/config.php with your database credentials, control IPs, and other fun stuff
6. Load up index.php, ensure happiness
7. Edit the virtual host configuration for the site you'd like to profile to 
    php_admin_value auto_prepend_file "<path>/external/header.php"
8. Bump your server, hope for the best
9. Hitting a file with ?_profile=1 should profile the page, refresh XHGui to see it.

There's a decent blog post on setting this up, as well as tips on how to use it at: http://phpadvent.org/2010/profiling-with-xhgui-by-paul-reinheimer
